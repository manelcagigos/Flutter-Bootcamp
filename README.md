# ðŸ“± Flutter Bootcamp

I took this Flutter/Dart course on Udemy to improve my skills in this IDE and language respectively, in order to be useful in my internship in a company focused on Flutter programming.

You cand find the course on Udemy here: "<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/" target="_blank">Udemy Course</a>".
<br><br/>
Also, I put the link to go to the GitHub repository of the resources of the course: "<a href="https://github.com/londonappbrewery/Flutter-Course-Resources" target="_blank">GitHub Repository of the course</a>".

It should be noted that all of these projects are done following the videos/tutorials that the course has (as expected if you are learning), but it is also true that I did all the challenges in which videos were not provided to follow, although it is not demonstrable. It's not necessary either, it was my first time programming in Dart from scratch and I learned a lot from this course.

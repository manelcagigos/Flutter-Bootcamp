# ðŸ“± Flutter Bootcamp

<!-I took this Flutter/Dart course on Udemy to improve my skills in this open soruce framework and language respectively, in order to be useful in my internship in a company focused on Flutter development.

You cand find the respective course on Udemy here: "<a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/flutter-bootcamp-with-dart/" target="_blank">Udemy Course</a>".
<br><br/>
Also, I put the link to go to the GitHub repository of the resources of the course: "<a href="https://github.com/londonappbrewery/Flutter-Course-Resources" target="_blank">GitHub Repository of the course</a>".

P.S. Thanks to my boss at "<a href="https://nexa.agency/" target="_blank">nexa.agency</a>" for letting me do this course on his Udemy account, at the end I plan to buy it on my Udemy account to get the certificate.

It should be noted that all of these projects are done following the videos/tutorials that the course has (as expected if you are learning), but it is also true that I did all the challenges in which videos were not provided to follow, although it is not demonstrable. It's not necessary either, it was my first time programming in Dart from scratch and I learned a lot from this course.->
